    "## 1. Federations table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns:** `federation_id`, `config`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- This table stores information about each federation.\n",
    "- The `federation_id` uniquely identifies a federation, while `config` likely stores the configuration data.\n",
    "- By examining the `config` field, one could infer member nodes and other critical settings for each federation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sessions table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns:** `federation_id`, `session_index`, `session`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- This table records session data associated with each federation.\n",
    "- A session might represent a period or a specific event, and `session` holds the serialized data about that session.\n",
    "- Analysis of this data could reveal the frequency and nature of sessions, as well as how federations are evolving over time (e.g., decisions made, changes in membership).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Transactions table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns:** `txid`, `federation_id`, `session_index`, `item_index`, `data`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- This table captures individual transactions within each federation, linking them to specific sessions and federations.\n",
    "- By analyzing transaction data, one can trace financial flows, understand transaction patterns, and observe the types of transactions occurring within a federation (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, payments).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Transaction inputs table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns:** `federation_id`, `txid`, `in_index`, `kind`, `ln_contract_id`, `amount_msat`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- This table lists inputs for each transaction, providing details about the sources of funds or data entering a transaction.\n",
    "- Insights here include the origin of funds, how much is being transferred, and whether specific Lightning Network contracts are involved.\n",
    "- This can reveal user behavior, funding sources, and contract usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Transaction outputs table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns:** `federation_id`, `txid`, `out_index`, `kind`, `ln_contract_interaction_kind`, `ln_contract_id`, `amount_msat`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- This table shows where funds or data are sent in a transaction, including details like amounts and contract interactions.\n",
    "- By analyzing outputs, one can infer where funds are going, how much is being transferred out, and how contracts are being settled or interacted with.\n",
    "- This could provide insights into the economic activity within the federation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. LN contracts table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns:** `federation_id`, `contract_id`, `type`, `payment_hash`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- This table records Lightning Network contracts associated with each federation.\n",
    "- The `type` and `payment_hash` fields likely describe the contractâ€™s nature and identify specific payments.\n",
    "- Insights could include the prevalence of different types of contracts, patterns in payment activity, and the overall use of the Lightning Network within a federation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Block times table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns:** `block_height`, `timestamp`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- This table records when blocks were created, correlating block heights with timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Block height votes table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns:** `federation_id`, `session_index`, `item_index`, `proposer`, `height_vote`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- This table records votes on block heights, indicating consensus processes within a federation.\n",
    "- Insights include understanding how consensus is reached on the system's state, who the key proposers are, and how federations agree on block heights.\n",
    "- This can provide visibility into the governance and decision-making processes within federations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall insights\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the data, one can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand Federation Operations:** Gain insights into how federations are configured, governed, and how they evolve over time.\n",
    "2. **Track Financial Activity:** Detailed records of transactions, including inputs, outputs, and associated contracts, allow for a deep understanding of economic activity within federations.\n",
    "3. **Analyze Contract Usage:** Discover how the Lightning Network is being utilized, what types of contracts are popular, and how payments flow through federations.\n"
