    "1. Federations Table\n",
    "Columns: federation_id, config\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "This table stores information about each federation. The federation_id uniquely identifies a federation, while config likely stores the configuration data. By examining the config field, one could infer the operational rules, member nodes, and other critical settings for each federation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sessions Table\n",
    "Columns: federation_id, session_index, session\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "This table records session data associated with each federation. A session might represent a period or a specific event, and session likely holds the serialized data about that session.\n",
    "Analysis of this data could reveal the frequency and nature of sessions, as well as how federations are evolving over time (e.g., decisions made, changes in membership).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transactions Table\n",
    "Columns: txid, federation_id, session_index, item_index, data\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "This table captures individual transactions within each federation, linking them to specific sessions and federations.\n",
    "By analyzing transaction data, one can trace financial flows, understand transaction patterns, and observe the types of transactions \n",
    "occurring within a federation (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, payments).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Transaction Inputs Table\n",
    "Columns: federation_id, txid, in_index, kind, ln_contract_id, amount_msat\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "This table lists inputs for each transaction, providing details about the sources of funds or data entering a transaction.\n",
    "Insights here include the origin of funds, how much is being transferred, and whether specific Lightning Network contracts are involved. This can reveal user behavior, funding sources, and contract usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Transaction Outputs Table\n",
    "Columns: federation_id, txid, out_index, kind, ln_contract_interaction_kind, ln_contract_id, amount_msat\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "This table shows where funds or data are sent in a transaction, including details like amounts and contract interactions.\n",
    "By analyzing outputs, one can infer where funds are going, how much is being transferred out, and how contracts are being settled or interacted with. This could provide insights into the economic activity within the federation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. LN Contracts Table\n",
    "Columns: federation_id, contract_id, type, payment_hash\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "This table records Lightning Network contracts associated with each federation. The type and payment_hash fields likely describe the contract’s nature and identify specific payments.\n",
    "Insights could include the prevalence of different types of contracts, patterns in payment activity, and the overall use of the Lightning Network within a federation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Block Times Table\n",
    "Columns: block_height, timestamp\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "This table records when blocks were created, correlating block heights with timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Block Height Votes Table\n",
    "Columns: federation_id, session_index, item_index, proposer, height_vote\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "This table records votes on block heights, indicating consensus processes within a federation.\n",
    "Insights include understanding how consensus is reached on the blockchain’s state, who the key proposers are, and how federations agree on block heights. This can provide visibility into the governance and decision-making processes within federations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, by analyzing the data, one can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand Federation Operations: How federations are configured, governed, and how they evolve over time.\n",
    "Track Financial Activity: Detailed records of transactions, including inputs, outputs, and associated contracts, allow for a deep understanding of economic activity within federations.\n",
    "Analyze Contract Usage: Insights into how the Lightning Network is being utilized, what types of contracts are popular, and how payments flow through federations.\n",
    "Monitor Consensus Processes: How federations reach consensus on block heights and other critical parameters, revealing the underlying governance mechanics."
